# l_system
A fast, general lindenmayer-like system evaluation library in C++.
## A work in progress
This library is heavily work in progress. Things may change in breaking ways.
The goal is a bi-directional model which supports stochastic, parametric, and context sensitive grammar for rules.
Currently, the model is bi-directional, but lacks the other capabilities, which are being actively implemented.
